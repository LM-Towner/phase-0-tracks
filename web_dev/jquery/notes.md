# How will I tackle learning learning JQery on my own? 

## I have a few resources on my bookshelf that I will skim through to try to tackle learning JQuery

1. JavaScript and JQuery: Interactive Front-End Web Development by John Duckett 

2. Learning Web Design: A Beginner's Guide to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Web Graphics by Jennifer Niederst Robbins

3. http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/default.asp

4. After all of these are finished I'll probably check out some video resources and code along with them to make sure I can follow. 

5. Also to prevent myself from throwing my laptop out of the window, I will take breaks (5-10 mins), AWAY from the computer.
