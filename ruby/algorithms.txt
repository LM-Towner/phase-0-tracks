Approach shiny metallic door frame which houses two metallic doors that will seperate in the middle to box shaped room 
	if closed, press circular or retangular button on a panel to signal for the elevator doors to open
if the shiny metallic doors are opened proceed into the elevator
receive message to which number to press on the metallic panel within the elevator
scan the panel to figure out which number to press
press the button 
wait for the door to close and move to the side, others may get on after you
	if someone else gets on scan the outside of the elevator to make sure it is not the floor you desire to get off at
	if this is not your floor stay on elevator
when the doors open again, scan the outside door to see if this is where you belong
	if you do belong on this floor get off
